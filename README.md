# Monego

## The beloved Monaco monospaced font, recreated with bold and italic variants. Finally.

Bold and italic variants of Monaco were originally recreated by @vjpr but seem to be abandoned now. Font integration problems were fixed by me. Bold-italic version by @kokoko3k.

## The fonts variants
