# Monego

## The beloved Monaco monospaced font with a bold and italic variant. Finally.

Bold and italic variants of Monaco were originally created by @vjpr but seem to be abandoned now. Font integration problems were fixed by me.

## The Fonts

- Monego: The regular variant you already know
- Monego bold: A bold version
- Monego italic: A italic version
