# Monego

## The beloved Monaco monospaced font with a bold and italic variant. Finally.

Bold and italic variants of Monaco were originally created by @vjpr but seem to be abandoned now. Font name problems were fixed by me.

## The Fonts

- Monego: The regular variant you already know
- Monego bold: A bold version
- Monego italic: A italic version

## Install

### OSX

Select all variants you like to install, drag-and-drop into `Font Book > User` or double-click and select `Install font` from the dialog.

## How?

The new fonts were created by transforming height and width of each glyph, and modifying the font meta-data to allow it to be installed side-by-side with the system Monaco.
